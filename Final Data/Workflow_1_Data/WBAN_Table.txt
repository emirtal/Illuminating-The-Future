                                                 WBANMASTERLIST.HTML

WBAN: (Weather-Bureau-Army-Navy) WBAN numbers were the first major attempt at a coordinated station numbering scheme among 
several weather reporting authorities. Original participants in the WBAN number plans were the United States Weather Bureau, 
Air Force, Navy, and Army; the Canadian Department of Transportation; and certain German and Korean stations in close 
cooperation with the US Weather Services. 

It is a five-digit station identifier that is used at NCEI for digital data storage and general station identification 
purposes. Invented in the 1950's, WBAN station numbers were first used as identifers for stations reporting meteorological 
observations on the then-standard WBAN series forms such as WBAN 10A, WBAN 10B and WBAN 10C.

This is the official WBAN master station list and it is updated monthly. This report is in HTML format.
